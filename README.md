My Freesite
------------
This is a small, static website that I created to test out [Freenet](https://freenetproject.org/). It includes my resume in HTML format.

My FreeSite is located at: USK@-UKIsA~4wzwSUSMlkp7teTmJ4Kl8jBxhe9E7YQpOE~o,ZASCKzZC5TVpD7~F7Pu5if2xJ8pe6Tf9~8aYNL5m4BI,AQACAAE/rkelley/4

Keep in mind, you **must have Freenet installed** to access the site using this address.

Why?
----

I believe strongly in the value of Freedom of Speech to our society. I believe strongly in the importance of freedom in general, and I believe every human should have the dignity of deciding their own path as long as they don't commit malicious acts that harm others. I also believe in the value of government, but I think it's very important that a government's power be checked by a democratic system of electing officials, where all citizens have equal rights.

Anyway, this is what interests me about Freenet. While I have long respected the power and benefits of Tor, I don't have very much in common with a large portion of the Tor community, and therefore its appeal is less. I like Freenet because it's an alternative system to the web, where all users donate computer resources to power the network, and privacy and anonymity are respect. While I don't use anonymity in this case, I like that it exists.

As far as I can tell, Freenet is legal, and running a Freenet node is legal. I'm not a lawyer however, so I can't be totally sure. So for now, I'm simply creating a static site to test out Freenet--and also post my resume in case anyone wants to hire me...

More About Freenet
------------------

A great description of Freenet is available at the [project's website](https://freenetproject.org/whatis.html).

Freenet is not Tor, it is a self-contained network. Tor on the other hand, is a protocol for accessing the web, as well as hidden services, anonymously.
