My Freesite
------------
This is a small, static website that I created to test out [Freenet](https://freenetproject.org/). It includes my resume in HTML format.

More About Freenet
------------------

A great description of Freenet is available at the [project's website](https://freenetproject.org/whatis.html).

Freenet is not Tor, it is a self-contained network. Tor on the other hand, is a protocol for accessing the web, as well as hidden services, anonymously.
