		<p>This song goes out
			To all the people out there that be running they mouth
			And they don't know what
			The hell they sayin'
			Shut up!
		</p>

		<p>
			Now that I've got my voice back let me start off sayin' that
			I appreciate the fans around the world that had my back
			And I just wanna thank God upstairs for keeping His hands on me
			And keeping all the doctors focused through my surgery
			Now, there's a couple of things I gotta get off my chest
			Some serious issues that I must address so
			Well, let's just get right to people said that I was done
			Said there was no way this time he's gonna over come
			And even before the doctors was done and I could awake
			A tsunami of rumors had come to wipe my career away
			After twenty two years of a blessed career
			Had me lying in my hospital bed crying mad tears ooh
			But just as I have many people hatin' me
			Had so many people loving me
			And let's not forget the hood around the world covering me
			And to everybody that be calling me
			Telling what they've been sayin' about me
			Bringin' all of this negative shit and
			Y'all the ones I ain't fucking with
			It's time for me to evaluate the people that I let up in my space
			Can I get a witness for all of this
			When people all up in your business
		</p>

		<p>
			Tell 'em shut up, tell 'em shut up
			Tell 'em shut up!
			I'm talking to you
			Tell 'em all shut up,
			Tell 'em all shut up
			Tell 'em all shut up
			And tell 'em, I'm talking to you
		</p>

		<p>
			He's washed up, he's lost it
			He ain't gotta no more
			Well I'm here to tell you today boy you haters are so slow
			And it saddens me to know
			Some of y'all want me to go away
			Well when it's time for me to go
			My God is gonna orchestrate
			Until then I will accept the stones
			Pray and try to get along but sometimes it's so hard for me to be strong
			See I got kids and I'm tryin' to love 'em
			So many things that I'm tryin' to juggle
			But I never thought this music would become my struggle oh
			The news said I lost my house my own people put me down
			And my friends no longer around no
			But you see deep underneath the surface
			I feel something's working in my behalf a victory is near yeah
			See my future ain't my past it's not the end of the hour glass
			Who said it would not last
			Fans sick they ass
		</p>

		<p>Tell 'em shut up, shut up, shut up
			Tell 'em shut up, I'm talking
			I'm talking to you, shut ooh, shut up, shut up, shut up y'all
			Shut up, if you talking 'bout me I'm talking to you</p>

			<p>
				Now seriously after all these hits and melodies and memories
				You compare me to someone else O-M-G
				Now no offense to the other artist but come on dawg
				Let's be honest how many babies been made off me O-M-G
				Seriously you gonna act like that
				Sit there like it ain't no truth to that
				Looking at me like I ain't talking stats O-M-G
				Every boy, every girl, every child around the world
				From the 90's up until today was made off me
			</p>

			<p>
				Shut up, shut up, shut up
				Shut up, shut up, shut up, I'm talking to you
				Shut up, shut up, shut up
				Shut up, 'bout my life, shut up, 'bout my life, I'm talking to you
				(If the shoe fits, go ahead and wear it) Shut up, shut up, shut up
				Shut up, shut up, shut up, I'm talking to you
				Shut up (Told ya's just shut up, just shut up, just shut up) shut up, shut up
				I'm talking to you
				Shut up, shut up, shut up, I'm talking to you
				Shut up, shut up, shut up
